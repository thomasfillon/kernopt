Description: kernopt is a package that implements Discrete Symmetric Optimal Kernel for estimating count data distributions, as described by T. Senga Kiessé and G. Durrieu (2024).The nonparametric estimator using the discrete symmetric optimal kernel was illustrated on simulated data sets and a real-word data set included in the package, in comparison with two other discrete symmetric kernels.
