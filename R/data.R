#' Fish dataset from the SIMTAP project
#'
#' The SIMTAP project (Self-sufficient Integrated Multi-Trophic AquaPonic
#' systems)  aimed to develop sustainable aquaculture production system
#' that, in particular, contributes to reduce fish feed inputs and
#' resources consumption. We used data from an experiment in which gilthead
#' seabream (sparus aurata) were stocked in 1.6 m3 tanks at a density
#' of 1.5 kg·m−3 .
#' Fish were reared for 46 days in a single recirculating aquaculture system
#' composed of three rearing tanks. At the beginning of the experiment, a number
#' n =200 of the fish were individually weighed (dg), and their length
#' at the caudal fork (mm) was measured.
